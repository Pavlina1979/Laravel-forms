## Laravel-forms

This is my personal project from time, when I was learning Laravel because of some projects in my work I worked on.

It wos written in Laravel 7 but since this version does not support PHP 8 I rewrote it to the Laravel 9 (rewrote is strong world, most of the changes was in one file when all routes are defined - web.php).

It is multipage(10) website, each page has different form elements including input fields for text, email, numbers, calendar checkboxes, radion buttons and select list. And everytime you go to the next page, content of the current page is stored in the database. There is also resume page at the end, when you can see and edit all the content from previous pages in one place.
